# Directions: Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three. 
# Do this without using the Python max() function!
# The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that Python normally takes care of for us. 
# All you need is some variables and if statements!

# Variables
variableA = int(input("Please provide a number: "))
variableB = int(input("Please provide a second number: "))
variableC = int(input("Please provide a third number: "))

# Defining function
def largestNumber(variableA, variableB, variableC):
    if (variableA > variableB) and (variableA > variableC):
        print(str(variableA) + " is the largest number you entered.")
    elif (variableB > variableA) and (variableB > variableC):
        print(str(variableB) + " is the largest number you entered.")
    elif (variableC > variableA) and (variableC > variableB):
        print(str(variableC) + " is the largest number you entered.")
    else:
        print("Let's try this again.")

# Run function
largestNumber(variableA, variableB, variableC)
